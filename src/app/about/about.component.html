        <p>The Miai Website will balance 10 players in a custom league of legends game.</p>
        <p>Miai (見合い) in Go are, in the simplest terms, a pair of vacant points on the board that are equivalent in
            value. For example, if Black plays at A, White can play at B and suffer no disadvantage from the exchange.
